Here is my Social Media project.  

This has not been launched yet, but I plan on getting it going before too long.  I started building this project with Rob Bertram as a learning opportunity and eventually we both moved on to other projects. So here it is, unfinished. Honestly, at this time, there is not a lot of drive to complete this project, but that may change one day.

The social media project is named myCircle and uses React, Typescript, and Scss on the front end.  The back end uses Nestjs as well as typescript which is standard with NestJs.

This was a fun project to work on because I was able to learn how to use Recoiljs for global state management.  I also had to learn how to use ReactRouter which was a fun new technology to play with.  

Although this project is on a long hold for now, it was fun and has been a good learning opportunity.  Hope you like what you see.
